## An AngelHack Project by James Garijo-Garde and Nick Hartunian

### Meet up with friends and make new ones for lunch, dinner, or breakfast!

This project responds to the Code For A Cause Impact Award Challenge. Countless studies show that continued loneliness can lead to depression, which can in turn lead to a number of other health and mental wellness problems. Initially conceived as product to coordinate meals with friends on in our college communities of Tufts and UCONN, our final pitch is instead a more versatile product that works for any location.

This project uses jQuery (https://jquery.com), Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en), Koa (https://koajs.com), and Google Maps Platform API (https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform).

#### This is hackathon code. Sorry if it's icky.
